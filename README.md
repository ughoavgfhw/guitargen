This is an audio synthesis program developed for a senior design project at the
University of Minnesota. It generates audio samples in real time using
information extracted from recordings of an acoustic guitar. It was designed
for and tested on a Raspberry Pi.

This software is licensed under the MIT license listed in the main code file.
However, it uses modified sample code from the Raspberry Pi. The contents of
the rawaudio directory are therefore licensed under the 3-clause BSD license.
